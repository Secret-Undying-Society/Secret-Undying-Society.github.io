          <h2>tech suite 121</h2>
          <h3>7:30 pm</h3>
          <h1>SUS Meeting</h1>
          <h3>26 APRIL 2023 / 7:30 PM / LIBRARY TECH SUITE 121</h3>
          <h2>Attendees</h2>
          <h3>Thank you. Your bravery and wits saved us.</h3>
          <h2>Agenda</h2>
          <h3><b>4/26 Meeting Follow-up</b></h3>
          <ol>
            <li>I’m so sorry about Dr. James, she didn’t deserve to have her life cut short.</li>
            <li>She would be incredibly proud of her research team.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3><b>New Business</b></h3>
          <ol>
            <li>The Secret Undying Society had two tenants: to keep the Fountain of Youth hidden, and the demon Iepmog sealed.</li>
            <li>The Fountain’s destruction seems to have canceled the effects on whoever drank from it, which ended Godfrey’s miserable life.</li>
            <li>However, it’s unclear how Iepmog has reacted to this change. We suspect that He has been greatly weakened after relying on the Fountain for so long.</li>
          </ol>
          <h2>Notes</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Review our purpose. Some are discussing the disbandment of SUS now that our leader is a dust bunny.</li>
            <li>If this is the last time I write one of these, I would like to express my gratitude.</li>
            <li>To the friends I’ve made in SUS. Our trust was betrayed, but we can still depend on each other.</li>
            <li>To the researchers. Your tenacity exposed the truth we didn’t know we were hiding.</li>
            <li>As always, a new day is upon us. I encourage you to make the most of it.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Action Items</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Keep your curiosity alive.</li>
            <li>High-five whoever the kid that made the hilarious drawing of Godfrey is.</li>
          <ol>
          <h2>Next Meeting Agenda</h2>
          <p>If we meet again, I hope we can laugh and share stories instead of keeping secrets among us.</p>
